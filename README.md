# car-share-fare

Knowing which car share to use in Vancouver ([the car share capital of North America](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-car-share-car2go-evo-1.4504926)) is non-trivial. This tool aims to help by making it easy to compare costs.

## Todo

- [ ] add support for Evo
- [ ] add a basic UI
- [x] add CI to run tests
- [ ] add support for car2go

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [TSDX](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx).

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the project in development/watch mode. Your project will be rebuilt upon changes. TSDX has a special logger for you convenience. Error messages are pretty printed and formatted for compatibility VS Code's Problems tab.

Your library will be rebuilt if you make edits.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Bundles the package to the `dist` folder.
The package is optimized and bundled with Rollup into multiple formats (CommonJS, UMD, and ES Module).

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
